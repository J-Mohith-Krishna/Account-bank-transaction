# Account-bank-transaction
## Description-
This program defines a BankAccount class with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance. It demonstrates creating accounts for different owners, performing transactions, and checking balances.
## Explanation-
   - The program simulates a basic bank account system using object-oriented programming in Python.
   - It defines a `BankAccount` class with attributes for owner name and balance.
   - The class includes methods for depositing (`deposit`), withdrawing (`withdraw`), and checking balance (`check_balance`).
   - When executed, the program creates instances of `BankAccount` for different account holders.
   - It performs transactions such as depositing and withdrawing money on these accounts.
   - After each transaction, it prints out the resulting account balances.
   - This program serves as a simple demonstration of how classes and methods can model real-world entities and interactions in Python.
